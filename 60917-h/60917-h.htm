<p class='c006'>T. Weel John what do you think is to come out o’
thae terrible times? I believe our kintra neer saw a time
like this.</p>

<p class='c007'>J. Really they are fearfu’ looking times, and I am
really at a loss what to think about them, or how to propose
a remedy to better them.</p>

<p class='c007'>T. Deed John I’m truly at a loss mysel’ to ken what
would be the best remedy, but it is plain we would need
some remedy soon, for our miseries are every day increasing,
and the starvation and destitution that is amang us
is alarming. Hae ye nae idea ava’ what can be the
cause o’ a’ this bankruptcy and beggary that is come
amang us?</p>

<p class='c007'>J. It is often my first thochts in the morning, and the
last at night, to fin’ out the origin o’ a’ this distress;
whiles I think the Corn Bill has a great effect to hurt our
trade, and I hae nae doubt but it has had a bad effect,
but how far it would remedy the evil now I’m no very sure,
for wi’ us no takin’ their Corn, they wouldna tak’ our
Goods, and noo baith Russia, and Prussia, and Holland,
and Belgium, and France, and America, an’ a’, has gotten
Cotton Mills, and Thread Mills, and lots o’ our Mechanics,
and they are quite independent o’ us and our
goods. I think our landholders, if they had half an e’e
in their head, micht see that.</p>

<p class='c007'>T. I dinna think ye’re far wrang John, altho’ I have
heard some argue strictly in behalf o’ the Corn Bill, and
tell us if it wasna the Corn Bill our grun’ wadna be sae
weel cultivated, and its value wad sink in estimation, but
I rather think the lads up by are feart the rents wad sink
in their estimation; and is this a’ the relief John—the
takin’ aff o’ the Corn Laws—that we hae to look for, for
the bettering o’ our condition? if this is a’ it is a very
forlorn hope.</p>

<p class='c007'>J. I hae nae doubt Thomas but there is ither causes
that produce these great grievances amang us. Anither
great cause, I believe, is our great National Debt, which
hangs about our neck like a millstane, and I’m afraid
will sink us to the bottom if the string is not cut, and
what surprises me maist is to see sae little attention paid
to economy, to help to pay off this debt. It is grievin’
to read o’ the thousands, and thousands, and hunders o’
thousands, that is payt awa’ every year to placemen and
pensioners, for no purpose under the sun, but rank
wastery: ane wad think, when they see our kintra sinkin’
and sae muckle need for care, that they would be glad to
adopt any plan to save us; and they ha’e a capital pattern
o’ cheap government laid down to them in America, whar
the head o’ the house costs them only £6000 instead o’
£400,000, which some folk has to pay.</p>

<p class='c007'>T. I must confess John you talk very reasonably on
the subject, and if your plans could be brought to work,
they micht hae a gude effect; but there is a heap o’ folk
thinks that if we had the Charter it would work a wonderfu’
Reform amang us, and that we woald get a’ our
evils set to right in a short time, but I’m afraid it will
not be easy gotten to mak’ a trial o’.</p>

<p class='c007'>J. I daresay there would be a change, if that could be
gotten, but, as ye say, I doubt it will not be gotten in a
hurry, but I should like to see’t try’t, and see what effect
it wad hae to Reform matters; but there is ae Reform
that we a’ hae in our power, and I think every living man
and woman should mak’ a trial o’t to see what effect it
wad hae, there’s naebody I speak to but confesses that
there is a world of evils in connection with it, and for
that reason I think it is our duty to try it, and that is to
abstain from all intoxicating drinks, and I cannot think
that any man can be a sincere Chartist or Reformer, unless
he be a Teetotaler, for the drinking o’ thae drinks
completely counteracts his own schemes.</p>

<p class='c007'>T. Ah, noo John, are ye really gaun to tak a’ the
hair o’ comfort us puir bodies hae left? if it wasna for the
dribble o’ dram I get noo and than, I wad sink un’er my
affliction athegither; ye canna deny I’m sure but it raises
the spirits and mak’s us cheery mony a time, when nae
ither thing will do’t.</p>

<p class='c007'>J. O yes, Thomas, I must confess it raises the spirits,
and that to an awfu’ degree, sometimes to 80, but next
morning you will find them sink to 40, being 20 below
par, and then what state do ye fin’ yoursel’ in? do ye
fin’ your purse ony benter? do ye fin’ your head ony healer?
your character ony better, or your conscience ony
sounder, after wallowing in that sinfu’ drink? I trow no,
Thomas.</p>

<p class='c007'>T. Tuts man ye’re takin’ the very warst look o’ the
thing ye can tak’; its weel enough kent there’s mony a
ane tak’s a bit suck that disna drive themsel’s to thae extremities
ye talk about, our Ministers, and Elders, and
Magistrates, and Councillors too; indeed, the maist o’
folk that reckon themsel’s upish can a’ tak’ their moderate
dram and no rin to excess.</p>

<p class='c007'>J. Their moderate dram! dinna tell me about moderate
drams, I ken baith Ministers, and Elders, and Magistrates
too, that hae gaen far aglee wi’ their moderation,
but independent o’ a’ that, is’t no a shamfu’ bad example
they set before workin’ folk, (for poor folk maun aye be
imitating the rich if they can ava) to drink thae drinks
that destroy sae muckle o’ our grain in times like this,
when poor folk’s starvin’; every half mutchin ye drink,
Thomas, believe me or no as ye like, destroys as muckle
gude food as wad mak’ a comfortable meal to a gude big
family, and I’m creditably informed that there is as much
destroyed in one distillery every morning as wad breakfast
the hale town o’ Paisley.</p>

<p class='c007'>T. Hoot, nonsense, John ye’re surely gaun out o’t noo
athegither, I never dream’t o’ ony thing like that, ye wad
maist fricht a body frae ever tasting a drap again; if that
was the case ye wad think the hale kintra wad rise up in
a mass against it, our legislators wad stop distillation, and
our magistrates wad grant nae mae licenses. Hoot toot
John, ye’re surly far wrang.</p>

<p class='c007'>J. No, tweel awat Thomas, I’m nane wrang, for if
there was nane o’ the drunkard’s drink drucken, every
inhabitant in Scotland micht hae sax pound o’ bread every
week they hinna, and that’s but ae portion o’ the evil that
springs frae that curse; look to the misery and madness,
the woes and wretchedness, that it produces; we’re tax’d
to a pretty degree even noo to support prisons like bastiles,
whereas if we wad a’ drap drinking, a three-storey house
wad ha’d a’ the criminals in a kintra side.</p>

<p class='c007'>T. Altho’ there a wheen fools that mak’ themsel’s idiots
wi’ drinkin’, we’re no a’ to be blamed wi’t; there’s mony
a decent respectable minister and magistrate baith that tak’
their dram, and disna fill themsel’s fou, and if folk wad
only imitate their example there wad be nae great fear o’
gaun wrang.</p>

<p class='c007'>J. Ah, Thomas, Thomas, but it is a bad example.
Scripture aye approves o’ them that tak’ nae drink, and
I could gie ye plenty o’ instances o’t if you and I had
time; and to finish the whole story, it declares to you, in
Habakuk, in plain terms no to be misunderstood, “Woe
to him that giveth his neighbour drink.” The beginning
to drink is something like beginning to smoke or snuff, it
is fun at first, but truly it often grows earnest, as we mony
a time see; and I think, for my part, it’s far better to let
it alane athegither; and I think it is the duty of every
patriot and every Christian to give no countenance to these
vile things; and every man that drinks intoxicating liquor
is only assisting to support 40,000 men who break every
Lord’s day, by destroying the bounties of Providence, by
converting them into a most destructive and pernicious
drink. And I think that a man that would not gie up
the use o’ a thing that is baith useless and unnecessary,
for the sake o’ his suffering fellow creatures, is nae man
ava.</p>

<p class='c007'>T. Ye really gang a great length wi’ your teetotalism,
ye seem to think it will be a general salve for a’ the distresses
and sufferings with which we are afflicted; but I
doubt, John, tho’ we were a’ teetotlars the nicht, it wadna
better our condition a bawbee, in the present awfu’ state
o’ things; we’re gae an’ weel teetotal’d the noo, and that
sair against our wills.</p>

<p class='c007'>J. Nae thanks to you for that kin’ o’ teetotalism, that’s
no the genuine principle; besides, I am sure, if we were
a’ pledged, and sterling to the cause, we wad soon see a
different state o’ things, for I am quite convinced it wad
be a general salve for a’ our distresses. In the first place,
it would prevent 45 millions bushels of good grain from
being destroyed every year, which would have a great
tendency to cheapen our food, enabling us to manufacture
our goods at a cheaper rate, and to cope with other nations,
and completely put a check to the evil workings of
the Corn Bill; and besides all this, the miseries and
crimes, the misfortunes and calamities, the lunacy and
suicide, the Sabbath desicration and a thousand other evils
would almost entirely vanish from among us.</p>

<p class='c007'>T. Really John, ye seem to hae’t a’ by the back, and
I must confess, there’s a good deal o’ truth in what ye
say; but what wad become o’ our puir revenue if we
were a’ to drap drinking, there wad be a bonny cry out
then, for we hae facht enough to get the win’ rais’d as it
is.</p>

<p class='c007'>J. Weel Thomas, to be plain wi’ you, I think the
kintra is quite blin’ on that subject; I ken vera weel we
hae great revenue aff drink, nae less than 16 millions, but
folk never think o’ the frightsome expense that thae
liquors bring on us, mair I believe, than a’ they produce.
See the tremendous Jails, Hospitals, and Asylums we hae
to support; see the Judges, the Sheriffs, the Fiscals, and
the awful army o’ Policemen we hae to pay; see the
Criminals we hae to feed; the host o’ Witnesses and
Lawyers which must be paid for prosecutions and trials;
and the enormous sums levied from us in the character
of Rogue Money and Prison Money; see the thousands
paid for support of our criminal Colonies, for Freight of
Vessels to send them to these Colonies no less than 86000
being paid last year for that purpose;—then say whether
or not our country is benefitted by the revenue produced
from these destructive drinks.</p>

<p class='c007'>T. I really must confess, John, you have almost made
me a Total Abstainer, and I do now consider it my duty
to give nae langer ony countenance to thae vile drinks;
but I think we hae rather gaen aff the point a wee; we
were talking about dull trade, and the causes o’t: ye
surely dinna think that drinking has been the cause o’ sae
mony bankruptcies amang us, to crack our credit, derange
our business, and cause sic an unparalleled stagnation o’
trade.</p>

<p class='c007'>J. Deed Thomas, I dinna think we were the least aff
the point about the cause o’ our dull trade, for I hinna
the least doubt in my mind, but drinking is the cause o’
a’ this wretchedness we’re labouring under; for, independent
o’ the great sums o’ money squandered awa’ on guzzling,
and drinking, and gambling, which sums micht hae
keppit mony a Back Bill, I hae nae doubt but mony o’
ane o’ thae Win’ Bills were drawn and accepted under the
influence o’ the Bowl; and I am quite satisfied that if a’
our trading men had been teetotalers for ten years back,
there would neither have been dull trade nor bankruptcies
amang us; and our present sufferings are only a just judgement
for a’ our sinfu’ drinkings and horrid abominations
that spring from that source; and so wide is the evil
effects of the drinking system, that it has seized upon
almost every fibre of commerce, and so long as Alcoholic
drinks are encouraged and countenanced by the upper
ranks of society, and by our Ministers and Magistrates,
I never expect to see things much better, for all classes
sink under its demoralizing influence. Our Cabinet
Ministers, our Pulpit Ministers, our highest gifted Literary
Men, down to our humblest Artisans, all have suffered,
all have gone astray through strong drink. I wish
you a good night, Thomas—I hope you’ll go to-morrow
and sign the Pledge, and I trust we’ll soon see better
times.</p>

<p class='c007'>T. Good night John.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
